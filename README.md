### [Deployment Link](https://nytimes-reader-challenge.surge.sh/)

### Abstarct:

This application was a practice exercise given by the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.edu/?ads_cmpid=1064466865&ads_adid=72751730870&ads_matchtype=e&ads_network=g&ads_creative=341753979066&utm_term=turing%20school&ads_targetid=kwd-396607728906&utm_campaign=&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&ttv=2&gclid=CjwKCAiAm7OMBhAQEiwArvGi3Ecads3ExQ4ApVr9tlPvso4uDU-sNAOo8h98Z4t5iD8X4LLq5EH1dxoCUIwQAvD_BwE). The main objective was to build an application that consumes the New York Times Top Stories API, which displays to the user all of the current top stories, allows a user to click on an article to then reveal a more 'detailed' view of the article, and also incorporate some sort of data manipulation through means of sorting, filtering, or searching. The application also needed to be fully responsive across all devices.

From the home page, the user is able to select a different topic from the topic selector drop down which will fetch and render new articles on their topic of choice.

Time alloted for this project was capped at 8 hours - from planning stage to finished application.

### Tech Used:

- React
- JavaScript
- React Router
- CSS
- Miro for wireframing
- GitHub and Git for version control 
- GitHub Projects for project management
- New York Times API

### Wins:

- Completing the MVP within the 8 hour window
- Working through React-Router breaking update changes that happened during the build process
- Successful time management and project management 

### Challenges:

- Staying within the time window and scaling the MVP to fit
- Adapting to new React-Router tools and having to re-strategize mid project
- The Router update caused a big shift in pace and ultimately led to a downsizing of the inital plan which included a search bar as well as a topic selector
